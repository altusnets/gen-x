Colorado Internet Unemployment Claims SystemThe current date is:  3/25/2021 5:35:33 PMWelcome to the Colorado Internet Unemployment Claims Benefit ESTIMATORThis site allows you to get an estimate of how much your Colorado Unemployment Insurance Benefits will be before you file a newunemployment insurance claim.  Click here to go to the ESTIMATOR.How the Benefits Are Calculated?We will examine the separation from your most recent employer and any other employer(s) that you worked for during a predetermined 12-month period of time called the "base period". You must have earned at least $2,500 in wages to receive unemployment insurance benefits.If you file a claim during one of the months in a box that contains an asterisk (), the base period of your claim includes the months to the left of that box.   OCTNOVDECJANFEBMARAPRMAYJUNJULAUGSEPJAN  FEB    MAR    JANFEBMARAPRMAYJUNJULAUGSEPOCTNOVDECAPR MAY JUN    APRMAYJUNJULAUGSEPOCTNOVDECJANFEBMARJUL AUG SEP    JULAUGSEPOCTNOVDECJANFEBMARAPRMAYJUNOCT NOV DEC LAST YEARTHIS YEARColorado Uses Two Formulas to Calculate Unemployment BenefitsYour actual benefits are based on the formula that results in the highest weekly amount. (The maximum weekly benefit amount may be adjusted annually, effective July 1 of each year for new claims filed after that date. The adjustment is based on current labor market conditions.)1. The first formula begins with the total wages paid for the highest two consecutive quarters in the base period. The total earnings for this six-month period is divided by 26 (the number of weeks in the six-month period). That number is then multiplied by 0.6 to determine your weekly benefit amount. According to Colorado law, this weekly benefit amount currently cannot exceed $590 per week, or be less than $25.2. The second formula begins with the total wages paid in the 12-month base period and divides that total by 52 (the number of weeks in a year). That number is then divided by 2 to determine your weekly benefit amount. According to Colorado law, this weekly benefit amount currently cannot exceed $649 per week or be less than $25.The maximum benefit amount per claim is equal to the lesser of 26 times the weekly benefit amount, or the sum of one third of the total wages in each quarter for the 12 months of the base period. In order to figure out how much your benefit amount is, we use the above formulas.The reason(s) for the separation(s) from your last employer and/or your base period employer(s) might impact the amount of benefits that you will receive. Unemployment benefits are for individuals who are out of work through no fault of their own. If you have a separation from work that could be disqualifying, you may want to consider the impact as you decide when to file.Colorado Unemployment Insurance Benefits ESTIMATORInstructions To Get an Estimate Of Your Potential BenefitsIf you are filing a claim between 3/25/2021 and 3/31/2021, your unemployment benefits will be based on all wages from all employers you worked for between 10/1/2019 through 9/30/2020. Please enter your gross wages (the amount you earned before taxes were withheld) for the periods indicated below. If you did not have any earnings during a given quarter, please enter zero for that quarter.Since this estimate will be based on the amounts that you are now providing, it may differ from your actual benefit amount. To be as accurate as possible, you may want to refer to pay stub(s) and/or Form W2(s) you have received from your employer(s). If you refer to a Form W2, you will need to convert your gross pay from a yearly total into quarterly amounts.Note: This is an estimate only and is based on the information you provide.10/1/2019-12/31/2019$1/1/2020-3/31/2020$4/1/2020-6/30/2020$7/1/2020-9/30/2020$10/1/2020-12/31/2020$1/1/2021-3/31/2021$If you experience any problems with this application, please call us between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. Mountain time, Monday through Friday, except for observed holidays.

(The maximum weekly benefit amount may be adjusted annually, effective July 1 of each year for new claims filed after that date. The adjustment is based on current labor market conditions.)	1. The first formula begins with the total wages paid for the highest two consecutive quarters in the base period. The total earnings for this six-month period is divided by 26 (the number of weeks in the six-month period). That number is then multiplied by 0.6 to determine your weekly benefit amount. According to Colorado law, this weekly benefit amount currently cannot exceed $590 per week, or be less than $25.	2. The second formula begins with the total wages paid in the 12-month base period and divides that total by 52 (the number of weeks in a year). That number is then divided by 2 to determine your weekly benefit amount. According to Colorado law, this weekly benefit amount currently cannot exceed $649 per week or be less than $25.	The maximum benefit amount per claim is equal to the lesser of 26 times the weekly benefit amount, or the sum of one third of the total wages in each quarter for the 12 months of the base period. In order to figure out how much your benefit amount is, we use the above formulas.	The reason(s) for the separation(s) from your last employer and/or your base period employer(s) might impact the amount of benefits that you will receive. Unemployment benefits are for individuals who are out of work through no fault of their own. If you have a separation from work that could be disqualifying, you may want to consider the impact as you decide when to file.

Colorado Internet Unemployment Claims SystemThe current date is:  3/25/2021 5:35:33 PMWelcome to the Colorado Internet Unemployment Claims Benefit ESTIMATORThis site allows you to get an estimate of how much your Colorado Unemployment Insurance Benefits will be before you file a newunemployment insurance claim.  Click here to go to the ESTIMATOR.How the Benefits Are Calculated?We will examine the separation from your most recent employer and any other employer(s) that you worked for during a predetermined 12-month period of time called the "base period". You must have earned at least $2,500 in wages to receive unemployment insurance benefits.If you file a claim during one of the months in a box that contains an asterisk (), the base period of your claim includes the months to the left of that box.   OCTNOVDECJANFEBMARAPRMAYJUNJULAUGSEPJAN  FEB    MAR    JANFEBMARAPRMAYJUNJULAUGSEPOCTNOVDECAPR MAY JUN    APRMAYJUNJULAUGSEPOCTNOVDECJANFEBMARJUL AUG SEP    JULAUGSEPOCTNOVDECJANFEBMARAPRMAYJUNOCT NOV DEC LAST YEARTHIS YEARColorado Uses Two Formulas to Calculate Unemployment BenefitsYour actual benefits are based on the formula that results in the highest weekly amount. (The maximum weekly benefit amount may be adjusted annually, effective July 1 of each year for new claims filed after that date. The adjustment is based on current labor market conditions.)1. The first formula begins with the total wages paid for the highest two consecutive quarters in the base period. The total earnings for this six-month period is divided by 26 (the number of weeks in the six-month period). That number is then multiplied by 0.6 to determine your weekly benefit amount. According to Colorado law, this weekly benefit amount currently cannot exceed $590 per week, or be less than $25.2. The second formula begins with the total wages paid in the 12-month base period and divides that total by 52 (the number of weeks in a year). That number is then divided by 2 to determine your weekly benefit amount. According to Colorado law, this weekly benefit amount currently cannot exceed $649 per week or be less than $25.The maximum benefit amount per claim is equal to the lesser of 26 times the weekly benefit amount, or the sum of one third of the total wages in each quarter for the 12 months of the base period. In order to figure out how much your benefit amount is, we use the above formulas.The reason(s) for the separation(s) from your last employer and/or your base period employer(s) might impact the amount of benefits that you will receive. Unemployment benefits are for individuals who are out of work through no fault of their own. If you have a separation from work that could be disqualifying, you may want to consider the impact as you decide when to file.Colorado Unemployment Insurance Benefits ESTIMATORInstructions To Get an Estimate Of Your Potential BenefitsIf you are filing a claim between 3/25/2021 and 3/31/2021, your unemployment benefits will be based on all wages from all employers you worked for between 10/1/2019 through 9/30/2020. Please enter your gross wages (the amount you earned before taxes were withheld) for the periods indicated below. If you did not have any earnings during a given quarter, please enter zero for that quarter.Since this estimate will be based on the amounts that you are now providing, it may differ from your actual benefit amount. To be as accurate as possible, you may want to refer to pay stub(s) and/or Form W2(s) you have received from your employer(s). If you refer to a Form W2, you will need to convert your gross pay from a yearly total into quarterly amounts.Note: This is an estimate only and is based on the information you provide.10/1/2019-12/31/2019$1/1/2020-3/31/2020$4/1/2020-6/30/2020$7/1/2020-9/30/2020$10/1/2020-12/31/2020$1/1/2021-3/31/2021$If you experience any problems with this application, please call us between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. Mountain time, Monday through Friday, except for observed holidays.

Colorado Uses Two Formulas to Calculate Unemployment BenefitsYour actual benefits are based on the formula that results in the highest weekly amount. (The maximum weekly benefit amount may be adjusted annually, effective July 1 of each year for new claims filed after that date. The adjustment is based on current labor market conditions.)																																																																																																																																					
1. The first formula begins with the total wages paid for the highest two consecutive quarters in the base period. The total earnings for this six-month period is divided by 26 (the number of weeks in the six-month period). That number is then multiplied by 0.6 to determine your weekly benefit amount. According to Colorado law, this weekly benefit amount currently cannot exceed $590 per week, or be less than $25.																																																																																																																																					
2. The second formula begins with the total wages paid in the 12-month base period and divides that total by 52 (the number of weeks in a year). That number is then divided by 2 to determine your weekly benefit amount. According to Colorado law, this weekly benefit amount currently cannot exceed $649 per week or be less than $25.																																																																																																																																					
The maximum benefit amount per claim is equal to the lesser of 26 times the weekly benefit amount, or the sum of one third of the total wages in each quarter for the 12 months of the base period. In order to figure out how much your benefit amount is, we use the above formulas.																																																																																																																																					
The reason(s) for the separation(s) from your last employer and/or your base period employer(s) might impact the amount of benefits that you will receive. Unemployment benefits are for individuals who are out of work through no fault of their own. If you have a separation from work that could be disqualifying, you may want to consider the impact as you decide when to file.																																																																																																																																					
Colorado Unemployment Insurance Benefits ESTIMATORInstructions To Get an Estimate Of Your Potential BenefitsIf you are filing a claim between 3/25/2021 and 3/31/2021, your unemployment benefits will be based on all wages from all employers you worked for between 10/1/2019 through 9/30/2020. Please enter your gross wages (the amount you earned before taxes were withheld) for the periods indicated below. If you did not have any earnings during a given quarter, please enter zero for that quarter.Since this estimate will be based on the amounts that you are now providing, it may differ from your actual benefit amount. To be as accurate as possible, you may want to refer to pay stub(s) and/or Form W2(s) you have received from your employer(s).
